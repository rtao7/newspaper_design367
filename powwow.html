            <h3>On Wisconsin Annual Spring Powwow 2016</h3>
            <p><i>Rui Tao || 4.13.2016</i></p>
            <p>On March.27th 2016, more than 3,000 people took part in the On Wisconsin Annual Spring Powwow at Alliant Energy Center on the East side of Madison,WI. It is an annual  Native American cultural exchange that bridges the gaps between the university, residents in Madison and Wisconsin’s eleven tribal nations.</p>
            <p>The 47th powwow is hosted by University of Wisconsin and local tribes. The powwow provided an opportunity for the campus and Native Americans to participate in a culture exchange and learning about each other’s culture. </p>
            <p>The door opened up at 11:00am, and the performance started at 12:00pm. There were six main styles of exhibition dancing include men’s and women’s traditional and fancy styles, as well as men’s grass and women’s jingle styles. Different from last year, audience members were not invited to take part in intertribal dancing, which is a little disappointing. Around 2:30pm, the intertribal dance competitions began. As a foreigner, who is not familiar with the traditions found the procedure and the dance off hard to understand. However, the dance off, accompanied with enthusiastic war drumming, displayed a sense of tribal pride from dancers.</p>
            <p>Traditional native foods were also served at the exhibition, such as Rice soup, venison dishes, Indian tacos and fry bread. There were also many handmade souvenirs, beautifully crafted by tribal artists. </p>
            <p>This event attracted not only university students, native tribes, but also many local Wisconsin residences. They expressed huge interests towards the native american culture. One of the visitor mentions that their ancestors were responsible for what happened in the earlier history of the United States. Now she was glad there were culture exchanges like this, and she was glad that two cultures can clash/exchange in a friendly way. She was happy two cultures can live together on the same land.</p>
