            <h3>Legendery Badger Ballroom Dance Club Hosted Their First Work Shop</h3>
            <p><i>Chen || 4.13.2016</i></p>
            <p>Badger Ballroom Dance Club has been holding workshops since three years ago, however  they held the first workshop in University of Wisconsin-Madison on last Saturday, which 												atrracted a lot of students. Professor Smith was the guest teacher and dancer. He is good at swing, waltz and runba. He taught students how to dance a quick swing, originated in German.
</p>
            <p>“It was super fun.” Robert Lovegood said, a sophomore student on campus, “I’ve never tried swing before, you know, it’s too quick for me and I couldn’t find a parterner. However, here in this workshop, I did it!”It’s a smooth, fluid dance that can be performed to any genre of music,” Musko said. “They find it to be a good stress reliever during the semester.”
Prof. Smith also had a good time teaching those students. “I love swing. It is a dance where you can get happiness from. Also, this smooth and fluid dance can be performed to any kind of music, as long as you catch the rythmn.” He started teaching swing since five years ago, although he is only in his twenties.</p>
			<p>He told his studnets that the most important thing is to enjoy the time when you are dancing. “They were surprised,” he said, “Because they though techniques were the most important thing you should learn.”</p>
			<p>The workshop started with a short opening dance. Prof. Smith first performed a small piece of swing and then asked students to mimic the movements. After the openning, he tarught a small swing dance slowly, repeating movements agian and agian untill everyone was able to follow.</p>
			<p>He spent almost half of the workshop leading students practice on their own. Sometimes he just stood in the corner and let them try, fail and learn by themselves. 
“I did not used to it first, but them I kind of get the point. You gotta try it anyway. It’s dance! Be brave.” Linda Potter said, who attended the workshop and met some new friends. 
AllBadger Ballroom Dance Club was very happy about this workshop event. They are going to hold more workshops on campus for students. Anyone with any background is welcomed.
Come and dance and share the love and passion!</p>
